Reminder: 記取上次 "機率" 被當的教訓
- (x) 花非常多時間 "自己寫"
- (v) 花時間 "理解、內化助教的作法"
	- even 下次上課的時候問 to 避免「不會的累積太多」
	- because「看解答 / 讀懂」>>「瞎猜 / 不會還硬寫」like 準備學測

Note. topological invariants:
- compact
- connected, path-connected, totally disconnected



===

\[ Not Organized ]

Prop. $\mathbb{Q}$ is totally disconnected

Thm.
- closed $\land$ totally disconnected $\implies$ nowhere dense


\[ Not Taught ]

Prop. Sierpinski's Thm.
- $\mathbb{Q}^2$ homeo $\mathbb{Q}\times\{0\}$

Techniques
- for "舉例 / 反例"
- 用 discrete metric
	- $A\subseteq X$ is bounded: $A\subseteq B_{2}(x)$
	- {x} is open & closed & somewhere dense
		- for open: $B_{1}(x)=x$
		- for close: $(p_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in {x} converges to x
		- for somewhere dense:
			- {x} open non-empty, Cl({x} $\cap$ {x}) = {x} $\supseteq$ {x}
- 用 finite topological space
	- {$\varnothing$, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, X}
- tan(x)
	- not bounded => not Cauchy
