$\because$  $f_{n}$ diff. $\implies$ $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}f_{k}$ diff.
   $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}f_{k}\to \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}$ uniformly
   $(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}f_{k})'=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}f'_{k}\to \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}'$ uniformly, since $\dfrac{d}{dx}$ linear op

$\therefore$  By Thm., $(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n})'=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}'$

- 2. 問號是？unique expression?
HW5
1. 不懂，明明就對 是在講 $x^{i}$ 是 continuous 
2. 6. 為什麼 $Q^{c}$ Bad

\[ Not Organized ]

Prop. $\mathbb{Q}$ is totally disconnected

Thm.
- closed $\land$ totally disconnected $\implies$ nowhere dense

Techniques
- for "舉例 / 反例"
- 用 discrete metric
	- $A\subseteq X$ is bounded: $A\subseteq B_{2}(x)$
	- {x} is open & closed & somewhere dense
		- for open: $B_{1}(x)=x$
		- for close: $(p_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in {x} converges to x
		- for somewhere dense:
			- {x} open non-empty, Cl({x} $\cap$ {x}) = {x} $\supseteq$ {x}
- 用 finite topological space
	- {$\varnothing$, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, X}
- tan(x)
	- not bounded => not Cauchy
