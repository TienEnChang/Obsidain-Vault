My proposal for the implementation of the “Behavior Modification” technique
- Subject: Myself
- Current behavior:  
	- Go to sleep at 12:30 ~ 1:30
	- Wake up at 7:30 ~ 8:30 
	- Sleep duration 6-7hrs
- Goal behavior:
	- Go to sleep at 11:30
	- Wake up at 7:30
	- Sleep duration 8hrs
- Target behavior:
	- start the necessary preparation before bed before 10:30
- Design a data-recording system:
	- track the time that I went to sleep on a calendar everyday
- Selecting a behavior change strategy:
	- negative reinforcement:  
	    finish all work required to finish today before 10:30 and start preparing  
	    => reduce stress (negative-reinforcer)  
	    => more inclined to keep it as a habit (response strengthened)
	- positive reinforcement  
	    if I finish all preparations before 11:30, I can use the remaining time for messaging with friends  
	    => social interaction induces positive emotion (positive-reinforcer)
	    => more inclined to finish preparation quicker (response strengthened)

Final thoughts, I think with the help of these proven techniques widely used by the field of psychology, the improvement will be very significant!
