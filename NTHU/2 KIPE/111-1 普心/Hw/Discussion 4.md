Me: 33
Avg: 14/15

“much higher”
=> unusually high degree of anxiety
!= anxiety disorder

This questionnaire not only assesses your levels of
(1) typical anxious feelings but also (2) the related physical symptoms. 
Therefore, the validity of this questionnaire should be very high.

  
Q1.
My score on the test is 33. It is considered to be at the higher end of the spectrum compared to the average score which is 14 or 15. The test result was not very surprising, because I already knew that I have a higher level of anxiety by doing the test on neuroticism of the Big Five personality traits last time at Discussion 3. My score on neuroticism was over the 90 percentile, so there’s no doubt that I am pretty stressed out.

Q2.
I think I am probably more anxious than my average classmates. I can see that the modern lifestyle is putting people in a more and more stressful situation, and smoking and drinking have been common ways for people to cope with stress for a long time. But I still think I am more anxious because I am attending more courses outside of the required courses of my major than my average classmates, which are dispersed in fields of psychology, tech-art, and mathematics.

Q3.
Yes, and it happens pretty frequently. I often experience a nearly unbearable amount of stress every time it’s near a deadline. I can notice myself becoming very restless, drowning in negative thoughts, and having an increased heart rate. It can probably be attributed to my procrastination, but I have been trying hard to improve on this, including starting the task at an earlier time and spending less time doing mindless browsing. I hope one day I can live a life with a better balance of stress!
