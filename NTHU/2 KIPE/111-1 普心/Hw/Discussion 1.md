The strategies that I currently use are as follows:
1. Encoding: I always try to take digital notes while listening to the class. This method helps me make concepts into lists with infinite sub-levels and can create bi-directional links between multiple concepts, which keeps the input of knowledge organized.
2. Storage & Retrieval: I think the best way to prevent storage decay over time is by repetitive retrieval. Hence, my method is that I try to review the notes of the courses at least twice a week, and whenever I think of subjects related to the concepts taught in the courses, I can easily bring up my notes to look them up.

As for the reasons that most oftenly cause me to forget, I think it's probably ineffective encoding. However, I think nowadays most people use to-do-lists and calendars to keep track of their errands and work, including me, so the informations are actually "encoded" into these tools rather than our brains. Therefore, what I mean by "ineffective" is simply a lack of organization and centralization of informations, and letting them scatter everywhere.Â And the other one is retrieval failure, if things become too much to handle, I often forget when exactly the deadlines are, which sometimes causes me huge troubles.
