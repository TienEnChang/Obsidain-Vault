Classical conditioning
- Neutral stimulus       $\not\to$ Response
- Unconditioned stimulus $\to$ Response    (pain, hunger/thirst)
- Conditioned stimulus
	- neutral (relates to) unconditioned = conditioned stimulus 
	                                    => conditioned response

Operant conditioning
1. crave more => respond more (button pressing)
2. target is active not passive,
     voluntarily operates on its environment to get desired results


extinction: no related "unconditioned stimulus" 
            = "conditioned stimulus" => "natural stimulus"

stimulus generalization: relate similar stimulus
stimulus discrimination: unrelate similar stimulus
