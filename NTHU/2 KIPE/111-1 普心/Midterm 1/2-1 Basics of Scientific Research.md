| Theory:           | broad Prediction    | from Phenomenon |
| Hypothesis:       | testable Prediction | from Theory     |
| Operational Def.: | testable Procedure  | from Hypothesis |
| Variable:         | quantified Factor   |                 |


Operational Def. may differ due to
- Logic
- Equipment and facilities available
- Perspectives of the researcher
- Creativity of the researcher

Research without a Hypothesis
- Lack of framework and purpose
- Post-hoc explanation
    (can come up with anything and explain everything)
- Compromising ethics
    (how much is too much / out of scope?)
