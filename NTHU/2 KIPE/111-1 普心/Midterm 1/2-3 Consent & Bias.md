Need a balence between <u>Participant Rights</u> & <u>Research Significance</u>
- ðŸ’‰ protection from physical & mental harm
- ðŸ”‘ right of privacy (data collected)
- ðŸ˜Š assurance of volition
- ðŸ“ƒ obtainment of informed consent

Conflict
- Informed Consent:   give a basic idea of the process
- Experimental Bias:  don't give suggestions

Human Subjects Review Panel: 
	must pass to be considered sufficiently ethical (by University, since 1970')

Ex: The Standford Prison Experiment
- Broad questions:
	- what causes people to act in evil ways? (WW2)
	- is evil nature or nurtured?
- Testable question:
	- How does a prison environment impact the attitudes and behaviors of typical adults?
- Research Design:
	- at "Standford County Prison" (modified classroom)
	- 24 people, assigned randomly to be prisoners / guards
		- prisoner: in cage 24hrs
		- guard: rotate in 8-hr shift
- Possible Flaws
	- Informed Consent: 
	    prisoners wasn't allowed to quit (wrong)
	- Experimental Bais:
	    the experimenter participated as a warden (choosed sides?)
