Kelly McGonigal
- how you think about the stress matters
  (breathing fast = more oxygen for performance)
- stress hormone: adrenaline & "oxytocin" (催產素)
	- also called cuddle hormone
	- makes you social, want to care about others more
	  => a built-in mechanism to "relieve stress"
	  => make heart cells "regenerate"
