EEG
- to measure
	- (x) action potential: firing  {non-synchronous}
	- (v) postsynaptic potential: tendency to fire (EPSP / IPSP)

equivalent current dipole:  inferred dipole from signal
                            (Fourier analysis)

signal:  voltage difference to zero level
sample rate:  continuous => discrete signal

frequency & amplitude of EEG wave
- frequency↑, amplitude↓: $\beta$(13-30Hz), $\alpha$(8-13Hz)
- frequency↓, amplitude↑: $\theta$(4-8Hz), $\delta$(0.5-4Hz)

resolution
- spatial:  detailedness $\propto$ sensor density
- temporal:  smoothness $\propto$ sample rate

axon hillock：first voltage gated channel (threshold determinant)
vesical 囊泡：neurotransmitters

Polarization
- mechanism
	- protein: Na+ channel, K+ channel
- phenomenon
	- membrane: (in:out) K+ more , Na+ more => axon charged

Depolarization
- phenomenon
	- membrane: (in:out) Na+ <= Na+ , + more , potential ↑ 

Conduction:  open Na+ channel$_1$ => open Na+ channel$_2$ ...

Repolarization
- phenomenon
	- membrane: (in:out) K+ => K+ , + more , potential ↑ 

Cycle: pl => depl => repl, time = 1ms

CT, Computed Tomography            ... structural
- x-ray
- application
	- lesions caused by a stroke / trauma
PET, Positron Emission Tomography  ... functional
- radiotracers / isotope
	- nature: radio-active partical
	- purpose: detect chemical / metabolic activity => bright
	           (related to disease state)
	- procedure:
		- avoid sugar / coffee (can affect radiotracers' efficacy)
		- inject solution with radiotracers + wait for 1hr
- application
	- dementia / mild cognition impairment (失智)
	- addiction (e.g. smoking, alcohol, drug)
	- language processing

MRI
- 原理
	1. protons aligned with magnetic field  
	2. absorb electromagnetic waves => change direction
	3. restore direction

fMRI

|           | MRI                 | fMRI                    |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| type      | structural          | structural + functional |
| signifier | radio wave emission | blood oxygen level      | 

HRV, Heart Rate Variability
- healthy: range of variance ↑
- sick:    range of variance ↓

Attention
- state
	- Selective vs. Divided:      1 vs. n items  (to do together)
	- Sustained vs. Alternating:  1 vs. n sets   (to switch from)
- level
	- Intensively Focused (1) => Chatty (5) => Riotous (9)
- test
	- More subjective: Self-report
	- More objective:  Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT)

PVT

Intelligence
- Crystallized:  knowledge         (recall old solution)
- Fluid:         ability to solve  (find new solution)

Mind, Brain & Education
- fields
	- Neuroscience + Psychology + Education
- dispute
	- affirmative:  provide evidence-based solutions for classrooms
	- negative:
- well-established concepts
	- uniqueness:      brains are unique as faces do
	- connectedness:   new info =(connects to)> old info
	- neuroplasticity
		- structural:  a
