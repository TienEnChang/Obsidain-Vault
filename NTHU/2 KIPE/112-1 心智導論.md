\> <u>Memory failure</u> predicted by <u>attention lapsing</u> and <u>media multitasking</u>

Hi everyone, the paper we're going to present today is titled " (Title) ".

My name is 張添恩, and I will be covering the first half of the presentation, and then 馬安辰 will carry on the rest of the work.

So let's begin !!


\> Hypotheses

The authors of this paper proposed 3 hypotheses on the potential causes of memory failure.

The first one is that the occurence of attention lapses just before one tries to access their memory, could make their memory less accessible.
Resulting a worse performance on the assigned task.

Directly following from this, the second hypothesis is that the researchers think that we can observe a negative correlation between one's memory accuracy and their tendency towards attension lapsing.

And the third hypothesis is that this tendency towards attension lapsing might be positively correlated with one's severity of media-multitasking behavior. Which to be consistent with the second hypothesis, we should be observing another negative correlation between memory accuracy and one's severity of media-multitasking.

If the above hypotheses turn out to be all correct, then we can conclude that to prevent from potential memory degradation, one should avoid using multiple media sources at the same time.


\> Measurement on media-multitasking behavior

To quantify the participants' severity of MMT behavior, the researchers use a 2-part questionaire.

The first part identifies the main sources of media that one relies upon, 
which is categorized by 
1. reading
2. homework
3. movie
4. music
5. video gaming
6. browsing
7. texting
8. phone calling

And the second part identifies the most frequently occuring MMT behaviors by a 4-point Likert Scale. Which if combined with the information from the first part, will give us the severity of such behaviors.


\> Experiment on the Hypotheses

Now, let's talk about the experiment design. 

The entire process is divided into an encoding phase and a retrieval phase.
In the encoding phase, the particpants were asked to memorize 168 objects along with their properties, which is either pleasant or unpleasant conceptual-wise, and either big or small perceptual-wise.

In each trial, the participant first took a 4s break from the last trial, and then were prompt with a question asking about a particular property. Then, in about 3s, the participant need to decide whether the object presented to them matches with the property described in the question, by clicking yes or no with their mouse.

After all 168 trials were done, the participant underwent a slightly longer break. And then, the participant will do a second run on the same 168 objects. Only at this time, the order of appearence and the questions paired to each object was re-shuffled by a program.
