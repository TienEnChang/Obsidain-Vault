- Explicit memory
- Implicit memory:  unaware of info collection

- Models
	- Atkinson Shriffin's multistore model
	- Levels-of-processing model
	- Working memory model

	- duration
		- sensory: 1 sec
			- iconic, echoic
		- STM: 15 ~ 25 sec
		- LTM: ...
			- {no capacity limit}
			- procedural:  riding a bike, driving a car  {implicit}
			- declarative                                                     {explicit}
				- semantic = non-personal
				- episodic = personal exp.
	- rehearsal
		- repetitive = in STM
		- elaborative = to LTM

- Levels-of-processing model  (how deeply processed is it?)
	- levels
		- 1. Physical / Visual
		- 2. Phonological / Audio
		- 3. Semantic
	- memorize
		- mere exposure: 重複 / 大量
		- self reference: 跟 親身經驗 連結
	- elaborate
		- within item: 理解本身
		- between item: 連結他者

- Working memory model
	- redefine
		- STM: all
		- LTM: recently activated part
	- model
		- CPU
			- central executive             (control unit / arith-logic unit)
			- episodic buffer                 (cache)
		- Memory U.
			- visuospatial sketchpad  (flash drive, SSD)
			- phonological loop            (flash drive, SSD)
		- External
			- LTM                                       (hard drive, HDD)
