- Timothy: From your feedback on the TM 1, you must have been inspired by Lulu’s successful host of the Group Discussion. Having high expectations of yourself, you must have spent tremendous time preparing for this leading role. Congratulations! You made it. Your opening was quite warm and formal when introducing your teammates and the timer, Eugene. The miner modification of the timer’s role motivated a timer to engage more. When hosting the prepared speech, you could provide brief comments on each speech before introducing the next one. Toward the end of the program, you sincerely showed your appreciation to the whole group for their cooperation. You could speak quite fluently. If you can avoid using monotonous tone when hosting any program in the future, you may get more resonance from the audience.
