- [ Mistakes from last time ]
- All
	- Forgot to give “microphones”
- Prepared Speech
	- Forgot to invite them to sit in the front ⇒ Head TM’s job
	- Forgot to instruct them the “preferable cue” for “next slide” ⇒ Head TM’s job
	- No one know how to control the “projection screen” ⇒ Need one helper
