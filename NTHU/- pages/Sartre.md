Q
- how to defend freewill with emergentism


no pre-ordained principles / moral code
no pre-determined mechanistic causality, God's teleology, solely socially determined => we're free



freedom
- ≠ wish anything can come true
- = chosen vs. not-chosen path
- = what "you're going to do" with what's "already done to you" (defiant)

a priori (comes before), precedes, a posteriori (comes after)

the absurdity of the world
- def
	- aware of existence as it is
	- stripped away of: any of the 
		- prejudices
		- stabilizing assumption lent to us by day-to-day routine

human is free
- def
	- with huge possibility/potential
	- purpose is not "pre-ordained/inherent/predetermined", is created/assigned
	- things don't have to be the way they are
		- don't be confined to the convention/tradition/normality
	- motivated by anguish of existence
- syn
	- we always have choices, autonomy

bad faith
- def
	- things have to be a certain way
	  shut our eyes to alternative options
	- too fixated into a particular role (waiter)
	  rather than a free man (fisher, driver)
- instance
	- have to do this particular job
	- have to live with this particular person
	- have to marry someone
	- have to own a place call home

crippled by capitalism, money
- def
	- passivity
- instance
	- I would do that if I wouldn't have to worry about money
	  (just excuse, not because of price)

capitalism
- def
	- giant machine for creating necessity (have to get it)
	  doesn't pre-exist (convention? norm?)
- effect
	- work a certain amount of hours
	- buy certain product
	- exert specific worldview (postmodernism)

< charges >

it is quietism (不做任何事):
- no inherent better option
	- lack motivation to change for the better
	- remain status quo
defence
- encourage inventing one's essence, re-evaluate & improve

it is pessimistic
- anxiety, despair, meaninglessness
defence (optimistic)
- it's all up to you

it is subjectivism/individualism/relativism
defence
- self is defined through
	- intersubjectivity
	- self-world action relationship
- choosing for oneself = choose for other people
- morality
	- about rejection to universal moral code (commonly accepted)
	- rather
		- (bad) find out bad faith
		- (good)
			- live authentic honestly to one's moral value
			- preservation of others' freedom

it is nihilistic
defence
- it can be, and can be not. up to each person

human condition
- def
	- historically, through human action over time
	- limit: institution, laws, vision for the future

image of man
- def
	- choose one's image, choose image for all man
	  => responsible for myself & others

anxiety = sense of profound responsibility = motive of choice

we cannot not choose = we always have choice

facticity & transcendence


- profound responsibility
	- law maker for oneself + others
	- because "to be ethical", it has to "also work on others"
		- => more weightiness

contingent truth: falsehood is possible, but not real

coward
- make excuses, blame the fault to others
- claimed he's being "triggered"
  => we gave "permission" to be triggered

stinker
- (x) human existence is necessary + has a priori human nature
- (v, by Sartre) human existence is contingent

ethics
- types
	- behavioral-driven ethics

free <> responsible
- we are pre-determined / triggered / made-to (bad faith)
  => not responsible
- we are free
  => responsible for consequences
