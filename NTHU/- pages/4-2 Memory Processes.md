- Steps:  Encoding => Storage => Retrieval

- Encoding
	- short-term
		- acoustic code:  聲音
		- visual code:  文字
		- semantic code:  意義
	- long-term
		- semantic code:  意義
			- => available for subsequent retrieval
			- => info is put into categories (分類)

- Consolidation
	- def
		- old info + new info integration  (老朋友 => 新發現)
		- cross-disciplinary integration
	- factors
		- stress:  may be helped by hormone
		- sleep:  REM is the stage for consolidation

- Rehearsal
	- types
		- overt / covert:  out loud / silent
		- repetitive:  retain in STM
		- elaborative:  move to LTM

- Retrieval
	- 3R: Retrieval cue / Recognition / Recall
		- recognition:  cue amount ↑
		- recall:  cue amount↓ (harder)
	- factors
		- availability:  學過？
		- accessibility:  想得起來？
	- failure
		- interference
			- proactive:  往前
			- retroactive:  往後
		- decay

- Measuring memory ability
	- serial recall
	- free recall
	- cued recall / priming
