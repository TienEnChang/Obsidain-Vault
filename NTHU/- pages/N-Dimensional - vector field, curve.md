Def. vector field
- $F:\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ where $m\geq2$

Def.
- same direction:     $c: r(t),\;t\in[\,a,\,b\,]$
- opposite direction: $-c: r(a+b-t),\;t\in[\,a,\,b\,]$
- $\implies\displaystyle\int_{-c} h\cdot dr=-\int_{c} h\cdot dr$

Def.
- Jordan curve: ?

Thm. Jordan Thm.
- $c$ is [[#^d47ff4|simple]] $\land$ [[#^c55d83|closed]]
- $\implies$
	- $\exists!$ inner region of $c$, which is bounded
	- $\exists!$ outer region of $c$, which is unbounded
