	- I would like to thank Abhinav & Nelson for putting a lot of effort with me into preparing today's Toastmaster.
	- Now, before we start. Let's hear from Eugene to tell us about some tips to follow, to keep us all on our time schedule! Please welcome him! (拍手)
	- and we'll have Elsie, Roy, and Emily to give us some wonderful presentation. This part is actually the most anticipating part for me! Not just because I can just sit back and relax (哈哈) but the topics are really compelling to me, and I'm actually really curious about what they are going to present.
	- Brief intro to the topic?
	- The prepared speakers for today are Elsie, Roy, and Emily. Please stand up and say hi to everyone! (拍手)
