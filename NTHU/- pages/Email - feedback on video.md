[Is it worth having kids? - The Economist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPXGeQ5ADfk)

Hello professor Chou,
  
I'm writing this letter to express my opinion on the video titled "Is it worth having kids?" by the youtube channel The Economist.

The video provides a clear illustration of the difficulties that people with kids nowadays would have to face. On the cost side, the average amount spent on child care until the age of 17 in the US is $286,717, and another $127,092 would need to be added if the child plans to go to university. This is a big financial burden and can easily be overwhelming for most families. Another big issue aside from this is parental leave. In all the countries around the world, only the Nordic countries provide decent parental leave. Other countries, including Taiwan, have a much harsher environment for parents, which makes it difficult to balance family and work. To make the matter even worse, parents who wish to return to their jobs after parental leave are most likely going to encounter a substantial pay gap, which makes it even harder for families to support their expanded expenditure. With so many difficulties mentioned above, no wonder people are becoming less and less willing to give birth to new children.

Originally I feel the same kind of concern. I was really against having kids and would rather live a life with more freedom and less obligations to fulfill. But after watching the interviews with the parents in the video, I suddenly realized how ignorant and selfish I was. I now think that one should be more grateful for their parents' upbringing, and that they should be feeling a sense of responsibility to pass down the favor to the next generation. So what this means is that in the future, when I've come to a stage of life with enough financial resources, I would like to raise just one kid, and do my best to take good care of him/her.

Best, Timothy. Department of Economics.

- other supporting arguments
	- during the day, alternating between: playful & joy / distressful
	- takes up a lot of time & energy
	- income? single parent? welfare system ⇒ higher level of happiness
	- people don’t regret ⇒ the family becomes more complete
	- I have been benefited from the society ⇒ should give new life to sustain it (延續)
	- give him/her good education to continue to contribute to the society (傳承)

- Fact
	- Overtime, birth rate ↓
		- why?
			- In the past
				- children workforce (童工), take care of the elderlies ⇒ easier for them
			- nowadays
				- less benefits / change in attitude
					- pension (養老金) ⇒ elderlies less reliant on youngsters, more on government
					- women receiving higher education, homemaker ⇒ workforce, no time to take care of children
					- secularization (世俗化) ⇒ less importance of religion
					- women’s rights
				- more cost
					- education becomes longer ⇒ more costs to raise a kid
						- before 17yo:  US$ 286,717
						- with college:  US$ 413,809
				- effect: fewer young worker ⇒ support elderly ⇒ economic structure problem
	- Happiness / Life Satisfaction (Not Persuasive)
		- normal ⇒ bump (around birth) ⇒ normal (short-term)
		- not much difference between “have kids” / “no kids”
			- during the day, alternating between: playful & joy / distressful
			- takes up a lot of time & energy
		- factors:
			- income? single parent? welfare system ⇒ higher level of happiness
	- Parental Leave
		- US: 12w unpaid
		- JP: 1y paid (2/3 of full)
		- Finland: 14mo paid (full) , further leave until 3
		- Britain: 6w paid (full)
		- Survey: people have fewer children than they would like
			- why? 64% cited child-care cost
	- Afterbirth career impact
		- earn less (procreation pay gap), less competitive to no-children
			- men: short-term dip
			- women: longer, rarely recover (motherhood penalty)
		- why? because parental leave (paternity ≠ maternity, x3 more likely)
		- consequences
			- return only part-time (shift work?), change job
			- ⇒ their career couldn’t progress further
		- between countries
			- Denmark / Sweden > … > Germany (better paternity leave / gender pay gap small)
	- Pandemic
		- remote-work, flexible work-time ⇒ easier for parents
	- Gender Equality
		- paternity leave $\approx$ maternity leave ⇒ birth rate (higher)
		- e.g. Japan:  social expectation = women do most housework (explain low birth rate)
	- On macro-economic level
		- for stable population: ≥ 2.1 kids per women (most industrialized country failed)
		- problem of 少子化
			- not enough worker
			- more per person to pay for pension program & taxes
		- alternative method: immigration policy (not widely accepted)
		- how government should do
			- not do: coercive, don’t restrict number of children people can have
			- do: support families with children, put more public resources into it
				- more generous parental leave
				- cheaper child-care
				- flexibility at work

- Real Example
	- Before birth:  went back & forth a lot / hesitate, hard decision
	- Parental Leave:  only 8w ⇒ work full-time
		- baby: more interactive, started to smile
	- will redefine self-image

- Real Example 2 (Faye, Matt, Eloise)
	- 12 month maternity leave (last 3 mo unpaid)
	- child-care / nursery spending is huge (unexpected) (20% for avg-wage)
	- love to have another child
		- but cost is too much to handle
		- want to be self sufficient / not rely on income support
			- is upsetting…

- From interview:  despite the challenges, people don’t regret

- Decision: Have kids or not? Worth it?
	- Intro
		- Q: if so, when? how many?
		- Pro: bring joy & happiness
		- Con: cost a fortune
	- Conclusion
		- Governed by: deep emotion + practicality

- For me, how would I decide?
	- I don’t want to have kids
	- It’s too much of a burden
		- 優先：take care of myself + my career + relationship …
		- 次要：children (not necessarily)
	- moral obligation (道德義務) ⇒ change mind
		- I have been benefited from the society ⇒ should give new life to sustain it (延續)
		- give him/her good education to continue to contribute to the society (傳承)
	- people who do decide to give birth, reason?
		- mini-me:  to be evaluated
		- joy & happiness:  will decline overtime, should instead pursue meaning?
		- the family becomes more complete:  to be evaluated
