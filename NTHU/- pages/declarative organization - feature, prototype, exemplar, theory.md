type
- feature
	- defining:        strict
	- characteristic:  loose
- representative
	- core:       essential
	- prototype:  average
	- exemplar:   special-case
- category
	- classical concepts:  clear boundary
	- fuzzy concepts:      vague boundary


theory-based = mental model as category

types from "essentialism"
