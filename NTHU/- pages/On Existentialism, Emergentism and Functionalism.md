Outline
- Motivation
	- existence precedes essence
	- causality
	- vitalism
	- free will / determinism
	- Physical Causal Closure
	- scientific evidence
	- physical monism
	- emergentism
- Emergent Properties
	- defining == essential
	- emergent != essential
	- strong emergence & weak emergence
		- something-over-and-above: nomological dependence / supervienece
		- nothing-over-and-above: metaphysical dependence
	- identity; token identity vs. type identity
- Functional Realization
	- essential == alive (physical)
	- property of the constituents != essential
	- " Distinctive Thesis "
	- living organisms as functional & adaptive (property)
	- multiple realizability
	- multiple functionality => no essense

- Free Will, Determinism and Teleology
	- causation & explanation
		- causal-mechanistic
		- counterfactual, interventionism
	- mental "causation"
	- determinism
		- Particular Substance => Necessary Cause

		- bias
			- long-term / short-term
			- emotional (comfort & discomfort)
			- cognitive (right & wrong)
		- regret
			- best then != best now => refine / learn


- Goal Pursuit + Method Implementation
- Goal + Method Modification
- Self-defining, Identity is Goal-base / Moral-code-based

irreducible = not identical to the total effect of 

reductive explanation: interaction among the components
- (v) causal dependence
- (x) law explanatory
