Bank
- deposit: all on the account
- reserve: currently in vault + in FED's deposit
	- reserve ratio: $\dfrac{\rm reserve}{\rm deposit}$ = b
- currency drain: deposit => currency
	- currency drain ratio: $\dfrac{\rm currency}{\rm deposit}$ = a

Money
- money quantity: $\rm deposit + currency$
- monetary base: $\rm reserve + currency$
	- money multiplier:
		- "$\Delta$Money Quantity / $\Delta$Monetary Base" = (1+a)/(a+b)

Quantity Theory
- velocity of circulation: avg. times of repeated use
	- calc: V = PY/M
		- P = price, Y = real GDP, M = money quantity
	- calc: $\Delta$V + $\Delta$M = $\Delta$P + $\Delta$Y
		- $\Delta$P = inflation rate
		- $\Delta$P $\propto$ $\Delta$M  (印鈔 => 通膨)

		- what is impacted?
			- all interest rate 

RRR, required reserve ratio
- def
