- Okay, so. This part is for the prepared speech.
- I'm not gonna lie. This is the part, that I'm looking forward to, the most.
	- Not just because I can just sit back and relax (哈哈)
	- but actually, I'm very curious about what they're all going to share with us.
- But before we start, I have some words for the prepared speakers.
	- While you're on the stage. If you want me to turn the slide to the next one, just give me a thumbs-up like this (比讚), okay?
	- Also, each of you only have 6 mins at max, and Eugene will help you on that, okay? (OK手勢)

- Hi, It's me again. (笑)
	- Thanks to the 3 prepared speakers who gave us such wonderful presentations.
	- I bet we've all learned something new.
- But! As we were all listening attentively to their presentations (聽手勢),
	- there were 3 evaluators sitting in the back secretly evaluating their performance. (伸手)
	- So it's now time for the speakers themselves to learn something new from their evaluators!
- Let's welcome the next session's host, Nelson! (拍手)
