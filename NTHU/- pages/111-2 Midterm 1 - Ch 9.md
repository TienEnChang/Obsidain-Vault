- Depreciation ($\neq$ Valuation)

| Cost to Expense           |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| E: Depr. Exp.↑            |     |
| A: Accum. Depr.↑ (contra) |     |

- Revaluation  (三者需合併)

| Write-off        | Gain               | Loss                |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| A: Accum. Depr.↓ | A: Equipment↑      | E: Impairment Loss↑ |
| A: Equipment↓    | E: Reval. Surplus↑ | A: Equipment↓       |

- Depreciation
	- exception: land
	- assets
		- 始：cost
		- 間：book value = cost - accumulated depreciation
		- 終：residual value
	- expense
		- 間：
			- annual depreciation expense = $f$(cost, book value, residual value)
			- depreciation expense = A.D.E. $\times$ partial year + adjustment
				- if:  next-year A.D.E. > post-calc book value - residual value
				- then:  next-year A.D.E. = 0
	- method
		- straight-line:
			- A.D.E. = rate $\times$ ( cost - residual value )
				- rate = ( 1 / <u>useful life</u> )
		- units-of-activity:
			- A.D.E. = rate $\times$ <u>units of activity</u>
				- rate = ( ( cost - residual value ) / <u>total units of activity</u> )
		- declining-balance method:
			- A.D.E. = rate $\times$ ( pre-calc book value )
				- rate = ( 2 / <u>useful life</u> )
				- { double-the-straight-line-rate }
