- Hello everyone! (揮手) I'm Timothy! I'm the host of today's toastmaster program.
	- I'm pretty sure you're all getting very excited, right? (攤手 + 聳肩)
-
- And today, as written on the schedule, (清單) we're going to have a total of 4 sessions. (比四)
- The first one is the table discussion, which will be led by A-bhi-nav! (伸向)
	- Please stand up, and everyone, please give him applause! (拍手)
- And the second one is the prepared speech, which will be led by me! (揮手)
- And the third one is the evaluation part, which will be led by Nelson! (伸向)
	- Please stand up. (拍手)
- And the last one will be presented by our timer, Eugene! (伸向) and our general evaluator Big Jimmy! (伸向) (拍手)
	- Please stand up. (拍手)
-
- So, before we start, I have something to remind you.
	- Because last time, the timer only timed the prepared speakers, which led to some speakers actually went overtime.
	- So this time, the impromptu speakers, the prepared speakers, and the evaluators.
	- You should all expect to receive some prompts from the timer during your speech
- Our timer, Eugene, is going to tell you more about this. Let's welcome Eugene! (拍手)
- So, without further ado, Let's get started! Let's welcome A-bhi-nav! (拍手)
