- [Erythritol: Zero-calorie sweetener linked to heart attack, stroke, study finds | CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/27/health/zero-calorie-sweetener-heart-attack-stroke-wellness/index.html)
-
- name
	- erythritol
- feature / function
	- sugar replacement
		- similar
			- Erythritol looks like sugar, it tastes like sugar, and you can bake with it
			- It has about 70% of the sweetness of sugar
		- differ
			- doesn’t spike blood sugar / considered zero-calorie
			- erythritol has no lingering aftertaste
			- has less of a laxative effect than some other sugar alcohols
	- existence in nature
		- Like sorbitol and xylitol, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, a carb found naturally in many fruits and vegetables.
	- effect
		- “Thirty grams was enough to make blood levels of erythritol go up a thousandfold,” Hazen said. “It remained elevated above the threshold necessary to trigger and heighten clotting risk for the following two to three days.”
		- Just how much is 30 grams of erythritol? The equivalent of eating a pint of keto ice cream
- usage
	- stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products
	- It’s become the sweetheart of the food industry, an extremely popular additive to keto and other low-carb products and foods marketed to people with diabetes
	- some of the diabetes-labeled foods we looked at had more erythritol than any other item by weight
	- Erythritol is also the largest ingredient by weight in many “natural” stevia and monkfruit products, Hazen said. Because stevia and monkfruit are about 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar, just a small amount is needed in any product. The bulk of the product is erythritol, which adds the sugar-like crystalline appearance and texture consumers expect
	- “My co-author and I have been going to grocery stores and looking at labels,” Hazen said. “He found a ‘confectionery’ marketed to people with diabetes that had about 75 grams of erythritol.”
- labeling
	- “If you look at nutrition labels on many keto ice creams, you’ll see ‘reducing sugar’ or ‘sugar alcohol,’ which are terms for erythritol. You’ll find a typical pint has somewhere between 26 and 45 grams in it,”
	- [from video] no name required
- regulation
	- There is no firm “accepted daily intake,” or ADI, set by the or the US Food and Drug Administration, which generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
- the study
	- motivation
		- The discovery of the connection between erythritol and cardiovascular issues was purely accidental, Hazen said: “We never expected this. We weren’t even looking for it.”
		- Hazen’s research had a simple goal: find unknown chemicals or compounds in a person’s blood that might predict their risk for a heart attack, stroke or death in the next three years.
	- 1st attempt
		- To do so, the team began analyzing 1,157 blood samples in people at risk for heart disease collected between 2004 and 2011.
	- what they find
		- People with existing risk factors for heart disease, such as diabetes, were twice as likely to experience a heart attack or stroke if they had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood
		- “We found this substance that seemed to play a big role, but we didn’t know what it was,” Hazen said. “Then we discovered it was erythritol, a sweetener.”
		- “The human body naturally creates erythritol but in very low amounts that would not account for the levels they measured”
	- 2nd attempt
		- To confirm the findings, Hazen’s team tested another batch of blood samples from over 2,100 people in the United States and an additional 833 samples gathered by colleagues in Europe through 2018.
		- “About three-quarters of the participants in all three populations had coronary disease or high blood pressure, and about a fifth had diabetes, Hazen said. Over half were male and in their 60s and 70s.”
	- what they find
		- In all three populations, researchers found that higher levels of erythritol were connected to a greater risk of heart attack, stroke or death within three years.
	- 3rd attempt
		- In a final part of the study, eight healthy volunteers drank a beverage that contained 30 grams of erythritol, the amount many people in the US consume
		- Blood tests over the next three days tracked erythritol levels and clotting risk.
	- summary
		- The degree of risk was not modest
		- If your blood level of erythritol was in the top 25% compared to the bottom 25%, there was about a two-fold higher risk for heart attack and stroke. It’s on par with the strongest of cardiac risk factors, like diabetes
	- possible explaination
		- Additional lab and animal research presented in the paper revealed that erythritol appeared to be causing blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke
		- Clotting is necessary in the human body, or we would bleed to death from cuts and injuries. The same process is constantly happening internally, as well.
		- “Our blood vessels are always under pressure, and we spring leaks, and blood platelets are constantly plugging these holes all the time”
		- However, the size of the clot made by platelets depends on the size of the trigger that stimulates the cells, he explained. For example, if the trigger is only 10%, then you only get 10% of a clot.
		- “But what we’re seeing with erythritol is the platelets become super responsive: A mere 10% stimulant produces 90% to 100% of a clot formation,”
- study author's suggestion
	- “For people who are at risk for clotting, heart attack and stroke – like people with existing cardiac disease or people with diabetes – I think that there’s sufficient data here to say stay away from erythritol until more studies are done,”
	- “I normally don’t get up on a pedestal and sound the alarm,” he said. “But this is something that I think we need to be looking at carefully.”
- other expert's comments
	- Dr. Andrew Freeman (director of a hospital)
		- This certainly sounds an alarm
		- There appears to be a clotting risk from using erythritol,”
		- “Obviously, more research is needed, but in an abundance of caution, it might make sense to limit erythritol in your diet for now
		- “Science needs to take a deeper dive into erythritol and in a hurry, because this substance is widely available right now. If it’s harmful, we should know about it,”
	- Robert Rankin (director of Calorie Control Council)
		- the results of this study are contrary to decades of scientific research showing reduced-calorie sweeteners like erythritol are safe, as evidenced by global regulatory permissions for their use in foods and beverages
		- The results “should not be extrapolated to the general population, as the participants in the intervention were already at increased risk for cardiovascular events
	- Oliver Jones, a professor of chemistry at RMIT University
		- the study had revealed only a correlation, not causation
		- “As the authors themselves note, they found an association between erythritol and clotting risk, not definitive proof such a link exists,”
		- “Any possible (and, as yet unproven) risks of excess erythritol would also need to be balanced against the very real health risks of excess glucose consumption,”

- Pair your morning cup of coffee or tea there is a serious new health concern about a popular 0 cal sweetener is called erythritol
- erythritol according to a new study it has been linked to an increase risk of heart attack stroke even death
- doctor say it's an ingredient in some popular sweeteners and a range of foods especially keto diet products
- but it's hard to Identify specific drinks or food that contain it that's because according to the study there's no rule requiring the sweetener to be named on a product
-
- {waiver why is that what's going on with this is discuss now professor of health policy and I will Cornell medical medicine I should say where I go to the doctor Dr. Drew Kumar thank you very much I appreciate that he's also contributor To the New Yorker appreciate you joining us so good morning}
-
- [Q] Lori why what are the health concerns and why isn't this listed Sweetener that a lot of people are used in popularity in the last couple years
- [A] because it looks like sugar it taste like sugar what does that mean the calories and it doesn't affect our blood glucose level
- since a lot of people Diabetes tend to use it Higher levels of erythritol in their blood that much higher risk of stroke heart attack and other cardiac problems and
- so there's a real concern here I think that the mechanism might be that it activates Causes our blood to Problem
-
- [Q] Are used to use a sweetener in my coffee how is it different than those sweeteners or is it different because I'm sure people at home use those different types of sweeteners as well
- [A] Mixed in with a lot of commonly use Splenda trivia Bulk up and add to that sugary Got it
-
- [Q] I was just FDA approved this approved this in 2 00 1 and it's generally considered safe
- this is new research it's also preliminary research the one thing to keep in mind is that this is kind of the first passenger And there's a lot of limitations
- [A] And people with higher levels in their blood tend to have higher risk is correlation not necessarily causation
- they also focus on people with underlying medical problems diabetes people with heart disease Facts for the general population
