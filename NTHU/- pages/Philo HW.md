Main Pilars of Thought
- Instrumentalist: No Intrinsic Value
- Consequentialist ([[Types of Consequentialism]])
- Preference Utilitarianist
- Deconstructionist
- (?) Evolutionist / Progressionist

Connection to Psychology / Economics
- Preference = Design => Autonomy
- Consequentialist = Extrinsic Motivation
- Intrumentalist = Utilizable Resources

Agree:
- We all have to decide for ourselves, 
	we have freedom of choice, and need to bear responsibility
	we don't need to rely on external doctrine / value system
Disagree:
- Is "fear of death" really what's driving me?
Clarification:
- idle => no praxis (v)
- repetition
	=> for functional possibility to be able to progress
	=> or already reached existential possibility, just maintaining
- progression => for existential possibility

From Existentialist:
- the meaning of life / the reason to be alive
	is to fulfill some existential possibility
	=> what is the meaning of doing so?
	=> deny the need for a sense of meaning
	=> deny the dilemma between Existentialism & Nihilism

From Me:
- there's no reason to be alive, I just "prefer" to be alive
- this question is a plague, which can cause anxiety

From Existentialist:
- action is for functional possibility,
	then for the existential possibility of "Dasein"
	=> too self-centered, need to be "deconstructed"
From Me:
- action can be for the "preferable" existential possibility
	of all existence, for others / for living environment.
	( not "just" to support / accomodate my existence )

From Existentialist:
- existential possibility = ultimate / end goal
- 1.
	=> sometimes we don't really know what we want, we need to explore
	=> even if we do, we might be wrong about it
	=> don't be too certain
- 2.
	=> if all we do is for one existential possibility, how can it explain the change to different existential possibility?
	=> goal is not constant => no end?
From Me:
- only need small improvement at a time in a "preferable" way
- only need temporal solution that work
- embrace uncertainty, open to preference adaptation

From Heideggar
- praxis first,
	only we something goes wrong that we need to circumspect
	=> overemphasis on output / action / readiness-to-hand
	=> we need both "input" & output to form a feedback loop
	=> it ignores the importance of "using" information, 
	because we are not "manipulating" it to realize some possibility
	( but thinking = manipulating ? )
From Me
- perception + praxis work together
- perception => preference
  => problem => solution => praxis
