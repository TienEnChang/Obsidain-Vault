Would you isolate Mary against her will if you were the health organization?

I think I would still do the same thing. Though I really feel sorry for Mary's unfortunate encounter, it is a necessary evil to do so because protecting other civilians' well-being is the top priority of the health organization. We had to make a tradeoff between Mary's right to liberty and others' right to life, and I think they did the right thing.


What did you learn anything from Dr. Flemming's story?

I think the most valuable lesson I've learnt is to always pay attention to details and never deem any anomalies trivial, because you'll never know one day a little accident may lead to an extraordinary discovery in human history.
