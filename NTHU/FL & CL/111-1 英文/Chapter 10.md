Do you have any experience moving home? If you do, please share with us.

The house moving from Taipei to Taichung happened in my 4th grade in elementary school really had a profound impact on me. I had been strongly identified with Taipei since I was born. When I happen to recall some of the memories in my childhood, which are the genuine laughters and warmth created with my friends and family, it always makes me very sentimental and nostalgic no matter how much time had passed. 

Do you have anything like the trunk in the 3rd article that have strong emotional attachment and can bring up deep memories in the past?

Yeah, there's actually multiple ones! One of the most important keepsake for me is the farewell cards my elementary school classmates made for me for my school transfer. For a long time I would come back to revisit those caring and blessing words from time to time. Additionally, the cards actually helped me get back into contact with these classmates many years after, and we are currently still in contact on social media. What a surprise!
