is it good for the aboriginals?

How do you relate the movement of "discovering the New World" to the movement of "habitualizing the Moon/the Mars"?

I think this extraplanetory movement is an very bold and exciting idea, and I firmly believe that in a not-so-distant future, our society will eventually become advanced enough in technology and in economic prosperity to be able to make this dream come true! Some people may criticize that it doesn't benefit our society on earth thus the resources should be put into better use, but I think for any economic entity to grow healthy and sustainablely, constant innovation and exploration is definitely neccessary.
