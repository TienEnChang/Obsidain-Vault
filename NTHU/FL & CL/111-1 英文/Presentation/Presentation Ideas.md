Lessons from the Asian crisis hadn't really been taken seriously
How great is the danger that the global economy will crash again?
1997's financial crisis hasn't been learned to prevent crisis of 2008

Tiger economies: Southeast & East Asia
- huge engine of economic growth since 1980s
- the crisis took five years to recover
- The model: Thailand
	- a lot of foreign capital flowing in
		- Japan
		- labor and raw materials are cheap
		  30% => 9% poor population
		- more and more young professionals
		  graduated from university
		- is deem getting into the antichamber of sustainable prosperity
- 1993: the World Bank/IMF 
  - published a hugely influential book labeled as
    "East Asian Miracle" => investors flooded in
  - deemed as egalitarian, more equal society than US
  - focused on investing infrastructure, technology, education (highly promising)
  - in just 1-gen: farmers became engineers

In the 1980s: 
- the neoliberal restructuring of international financial system began
- deregulation: bank can exceed "vault $\geq$ lent" regulation
  (over loaning = rapid growth)
- cause: financier/speculators richer = more new-comer

In the 1997:
- conference of World Bank/IMF was supposed to resolve this issue
- it's in the midst of the crisis, they met in Hong Kong

The crisis
- companies and private investors had borrowed a lot of money => to further increase export (出口)
- the investment rush is based on the assumption of steady growth => companies borrow short-term loan
  (to get the quickest profit cycle)
- also people invest huge in real-estate
	- debt in US-dollars => profit in Thai-baht
	    exchange rate dropped => no profit 
	    => can't repay laon
- but, when companies in Japan started to have difficulties
  => Japanese bank get nervous and cancel loans
- the problem with exchange rate drop
	- Thai-gov tried to borrow US-dollar from China and Japan to return stableness but get refused
	- people lose faith in central bank because it's reserve slowly began to dwindle, so they rush out with money, and the exchange rate drop steep => crisis/collapse
	- leveraged run by the hedge fund
		- US can hold, Thai does not

The IMF
- pushed more even deregulation, celebrate capital market liberalisation made the thing worse
- force to stifle investment of any kind "at the height of the crisis" by drastically increase the "base rates (interest rate), tight monetary policy, austerity"
  => cause the depression
- didn't manage any problem => want to make AMF
  but the US Treasury DP strictly opposed to it
- US didn't loan maximum amount of money to stop panicking of speculators


Soros Fund = Quantum Fund
- Eng-Pound to Euro 固定匯率 (x)
- Thai-Baht to US-Dollar 固定匯率 (x) => 大量貶值

Soros 只是最大的 投機資本
泰國自己去開放了金融市場
- 炒: 股市, 房市 => 公司倒閉 = 失業

不可能三角

提高利率 = 貸款上升
升息 = 存款上升

景氣循環

利率 = 存款 & 貸款 (in = out)
- down
  = 炒股市 + 企業向銀行貸款
  = 炒房市 + 個人向銀行貸款 (作為經濟復甦 of COVID)
  = 好景氣 (市場上太多熱錢 = 泡沫)
  then
  消費力增加, 供給力不足 = 以價制量up = 通貨膨脹 (x)
- up
  = 斷資金 = 市值蒸發 / 公司倒閉
  = 壞景氣


Time Order
- 1980s: 
	- neo-liberalism restructuring of economics
	  = lower interest rate
	  = deregulation: laxing rule for loans (reserve < lent)
	     => "good" corps. can borrow more money
	     => "bad" speculators increase, 
	        short-term fluctuation-profit 
	        (currency, oil, ores, wheat)
- 1997:
	- A annual conference of IMF + World Bank 
	  (in the midst of the crisis)
	- increased interest rate

Concepts
- interest rate & inflation & market fund
- IMF + World Bank's purpose
- Event 受害者: Thailand, Indonisia, South Korea
