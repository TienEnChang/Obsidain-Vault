So that even with the over-expanding size of global financial sector cause by the US government,  
  
Thailand can still resist the overflow of cash into the country  
  
and can also prevent domestic companies from lending loans that exceed their capacity to repay.  
  
This can prevent the bubble from happening at the first place.  
  
A2:

Because no country can have unlimited amount of reserve to forever ensure the exchange rate fixed.  
  
So the country is always under the risk of attack by speculators.  
  
Once there's a sudden drop of the currency price, it will inevitably bring fear and panic to the public, and the chain effect afterward will make the economy collapse.
