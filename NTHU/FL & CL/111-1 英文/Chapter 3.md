[ Q&A ]

What is the value of anthropology?

I think the value of anthropology is in some way alike historiography. They both emphasize on documenting/recording the product of cultures, while the former is more on the horizontal side which is about cultures' features, traditions, and language, and the latter is more on the vertical side wich is about cultural events' chronological relationships. Though they differ in their field of interst, they both serve the modern society references to learn from. Despite their technologies are not as advanced as today's, there are still some form of acient wisdom deeply embeded in those cultures.

What are the pros and cons of foraging and horticulture? and which do you prefer?

I prefer the horticultural style of living. Because by planting crops beforehand, we can free ourselves from being anxious about the uncertainty of food source, and put more work into tehcnological advancement to improve peoples' lives. Though there are still some pros about foraging, which is that when it comes to catastrophical natural changes of the environment, people who forage can quickly adapt while horticultural would be losing almost all of their propeties.
