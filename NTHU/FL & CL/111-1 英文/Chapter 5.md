[ Q&A ]

How do you relate the Great Depression to the currently on-going stock market crisis?

I think we can all feel the significant effect of the rising inflation happening all around the world. 
~
In my view, the current situation of the stock market is volatile yet under control. But my biggest fear is that the inflation will become unbearable, many families will start to become unable to balance their expenses, and then the unemployment rate will rise up rapidly, which may lead to another major financial depression. Nevertheless, I still have faith in our government and believe that they will eventually make the situation under control.


Did the history of the Great Depression teach you any lesson?

I think it does! It dawned on me that we should pay more respect to the workers who maintain the quality of our everyday life, such as the construction-site workers, the food venders, the garbage collectors, who had been the dominant driving force for the recovery of the Great Depression. After all, we are all humans and we should be treated equally, and no one should ever be despised because of their relatively low status. Any work done should be seriously appreciated.
