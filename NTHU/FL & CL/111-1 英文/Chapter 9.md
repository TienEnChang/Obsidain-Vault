What's your opinion on Ethical Relativism & Universalism? Which philosophy do you stand by?

I believe that at the very least, basic human rights are universal ethics which should never be abused in any occasion and should be respected by everyone. Only when we all fulfill these least-demanding moral obligations can we cooperate together and contruct a progressive society that takes care of everyone's wellbeing. Thus, I believe absolute relativism universalism of ethics are wrong.

Talk about any real-world event that relates to ethical issue.

I think recently there had been a drama about a plagiarism conducted by the former mayor of Hsin-chu. Even with months of continuous lying and blinded supports from the party he was in, the investigation committee of NTU in the end still made the final verdict confirming the plagiarism. It reminded and proved to us that no one can cover their crime under the hood and pretend that nothing had happened. We all have to be responsible for our own act.
