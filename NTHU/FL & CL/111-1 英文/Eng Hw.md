How do you relate the movement of "discovering the New World" to the movement of "habitualizing the Moon/the Mars"?

I think this extraplanetary movement is a very bold and exciting idea, and I firmly believe that in a not-so-distant future, our society will eventually become advanced enough in technology and in economic prosperity to be able to make this dream come true! Some people may criticize that it doesn't benefit our society on earth thus the resources should be put into better use, but I think for any economic entity to grow healthy and sustainably, constant innovation and exploration is definitely necessary.

What's your opinion on Ethical Relativism & Universalism? Which philosophy do you stand by?

I believe that at the very least, basic human rights are universal ethics which should never be abused on any occasion and should be respected by everyone. Only when we all fulfill these least-demanding moral obligations can we cooperate together and construct a progressive society that takes care of everyone's wellbeing. Thus, I believe absolute relativism and universalism of ethics are wrong.

Talk about any real-world event that relates to ethical issues.

I think recently there has been a drama about plagiarism conducted by the former mayor of Hsin-chu. Even with months of continuous lying and blinded support from the party he was in, the investigation committee of NTU in the end still made the final verdict confirming the plagiarism. It reminded and proved to us that no one can cover their crime under the hood and pretend that nothing had happened. We all have to be responsible for our own act.

Do you have any experience moving home? If you do, please share with us.

The house moving from Taipei to Taichung happened in my 4th grade in elementary school really had a profound impact on me. I have been strongly identified with Taipei since I was born. When I happen to recall some of the memories in my childhood, which are the genuine laughter and warmth created with my friends and family, it always makes me very sentimental and nostalgic no matter how much time has passed. 

Do you keep anything like the trunk in the 3rd article yourself?

Yeah, there's actually multiple ones! One of the most important keepsakes for me is the farewell cards my elementary school classmates made for me for my school transfer. For a long time I would come back to revisit those caring and blessing words from time to time. Additionally, the cards actually helped me get back into contact with these classmates many years after, and we are currently still in contact on social media. What a surprise!
