[ Q&A ]

What other technological advancement do you think are as impactful on humanity as the advancement from compass to GPS?

I think that the advancement from paper to electronic documents is a really big thing for humanity. Because before that knowledge was rather inaccessible to people outside of academia and the poor, and it is neither good for the discovery of new knowledge for academia nor fair to the society which has every right to make use of this precious knowledge.
