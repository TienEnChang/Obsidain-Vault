[ Preview Question ]

Do you prefer the more tranditional Realism or the more progressive Impressionism and the abstract Expressionsim?

Have you had any experiences of visiting any of the paintings by the authors mentioned in the articles?

Yes. I once had a chance to get a close look at Monet's paintings at one of the art museums in Taiwan. My first impression was a shock to me. The colors had no boundarys and are all mixed up together, and yet if you get far away enough and use your feelings rather than your intellect, you can then actually see many hidden details in the paintings!

Can the Abtract Expressionism be thought of as doodling? Where is the professionality and aesthetic values of these paintings?

I think maybe there's actually no difference between a child's play of pigments and a masterpiece at all, because the artworks are not about techniques and accuracy but only about the expression of feelings and actions. Therefore, the aethetic value of these paintings are solely dependent on one's subjective preferences.
