- What is linguistics?
	- aspects
		- phonetics(語音學), phonology(音系學), syllable(音節)
		- morphology(構詞學), syntax(句法)
		- semantics(語意學)
		- pragmatics(語用學)
	- function: to express meanings
		- feelings
		- thoughts / concepts
-
- 手語 sign language $$\in$$ natural language
-
- def of meaning is vague / unknown
- language evolves through "form" => "meanings"
	- the link is arbitrary, no need to discuss
- form: word, phrase, sentence
- morpheme: smallest unit of meaning , un + satisfy + ing
	- correct splitting: $$\sum$$ parts =(express)> total
- semantic value
-
- How one can understand a sentence
	- need to understand
		- the individual words
		- the order
		  "John likes Mary" ≠ "Mary likes John"
		- the parsing structure
		  "John saw a turtle with a telescope"
		  (1) "with a telescope" =(modify)> "saw"
		  (2) "with a telescope" =(modify)> "a turtle"

- How one can determine truth / falsehood
-
- sentence is true / false is dependent on the context of utterance,
  and whether there exists a perceivable fact that verifies it
- semantic value of sentence P in C: $$\llbracket$$P$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$
- |is true in C:|$$\llbracket$$P$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = 1|
  |--|--|
  |is false in C:|$$\llbracket$$P$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = 0|
  |is a tautology:|$$\forall \,\rm C$$ , $$\llbracket$$P$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = 1|
  |is a contradiction:|$$\forall \,\rm C$$ , $$\llbracket$$P$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = 0|
  |are equivalent:|$$\forall \,\rm C$$ , $$\llbracket$$P$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = $$\llbracket$$Q$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$|
-
- if "Sam is on the mat" in C, then $$\llbracket$$"Sam is on the mat"$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = 1
   (meta-language)                                (object language)
- otherwise, $$\llbracket$$"Sam is on the mat"$$\rrbracket^{\rm C}$$ = 0
                       (object language)
-
- truth conditions
	- necessary condition:  con => object sentence
	- sufficient condition:   con <= object sentence
-
- even if it is future event: semantic value ≠ probability
-
- semantic meaning ≠ speaker’s meaning (irrelevent)
	- lying, sarcasm
