| Merchandising | Manufacturing       |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| inventory     | raw materials       |
|               | => work in progress |
|               | => finished good                    |

※ inventory, raw materials...
  $\in$ current asset, on stat of f.pos

| check accuracy/theft | know amount at hand |

※ taken at the end of accounting period
※ accuracy↑ when in 淡季


[ Cost Flow Method ]

- Specific identification  貨物<=>綁定成本
- Cost flow assumption     貨物<≠>綁定成本
	- FIFO
	- Average Cost: Cost$_{avg}$ $\cdot$ Q$_{sold}$

※ consistency is prefered
※ problem with
  Specific Identification: 
         risk of manipulation

- IFRS: First-in, first-out(FIFO)
        "先"可能會老舊損壞 => 用"先"
- US GAAP: Last-in, first-out(LIFO)
        "先"可能因為通膨價格失真 => 用"後"

Accuracy on COGS
1. LIFO:          Account for Inflation
2. Average Cost:  Mid
3. FIFO:          Reverse

Accuracy on Ending Inventory
1. FIFO
2. Average Cost
3. LIFO

- Beginning (v)
	- Cost A (x, ↓)
- Ending (x, ↑):     one-time error
- Beginning (x, ↑):  one-time error
	- Cost B (x, ↑)
- Ending (v)
=> 
- Cost A + Cost B is correct
