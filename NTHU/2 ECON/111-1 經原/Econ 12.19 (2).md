Oligopoly
- "High" Entry barrier => "Few" firms
- Need to use game theory
- e.g. petroleum, cigarettes

Entry barrier
- only few firms/country own the natural resources
- only few firms can achieve
  "efficient scale of production"

Can form cartel to "collude"
- act together to: limit output, raise price

Game theory
- is: a tool to study strategic decisions
- four common features
	- rules
	- strategies
	- payoffs
	- outcomes
- payoff matrix
- dominant strategy: 不論對手怎麼做, 選A > 選B
- nash equilibrium
	- dominant strategy equilibrium
		- The prisoner dilemma: 
			- decisions: confess/deny 罪行
			- because: 有 dominant strategy
			- outcome: 都 confess
		- The oligopoly game:
			- decisions: comply/cheat 減產協議(抬價)
			- because: 有 dominant strategy
			- outcome: 都 confess
		- The chicken game:
			- decisions: do/don't 研發R&D
	- cooperative equilibrium (repeated game)
		- if "cheat" will get 報應, so "comply"

Game theory's insight:
	pursue self-interest $\neq$ promote social-interest

Repeated Game: 重複進行
Sequential Game: 一個一個加入

可競爭市場 Contestable Market
- is: 既有廠商 face 潛在競爭者
- strategy: limit pricing => to increase barrier
