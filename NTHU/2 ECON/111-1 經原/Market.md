Perfect Competition
- cause
	- product: indentical
	- entry barrier: x

Monopolistic Competition
- cause
	- product: differentiated
	- entry barrier: x
- effect
	- compete on: quality, price, marketing

Monopoly 獨佔
- cause
	- product: unique 
	- entry barrier: v

Oligopoly 寡佔
- cause
	- entry barrier: v
	- few players
	  => decision can influence others
	  => game theory
- e.g. petroleum(oil), cigarettes, automobile

---

TC = FC + VC = $\int_0^Q$ MC + C$_0$

Let $D:\;P=a-b\,Q$

Natural barrier
- 前期投注大量 "初始固定成本"
  => 後期才能慢慢回本 e.g. 高鐵, 電信
Ownership barrier
- 佔據某種資源
Legal barrier
- 透過法律保障 e.g. 國營/特許權, 執照, 專利


Economics Profit
- entry barrier
	- v => max profit
	- x => zero profit  (1廠商 ≠> all廠商, S不變)

Price Setting Strategy
- assmue
	- 生產者 already knew the 需求曲線 D
- type
	- single price          $MR(Q) =D(\dfrac{Q}2)$
	- price discrimination  $MR(Q) =D({Q})$
		- by buyer group
		- by good unit 
- decision
	- $MR =MC$ => $Q$ => $P(Q)$

Rent Seeking
- To 維持 Monopoly
  => 增加額外 Fixed Cost (遊說, 槍砲, 養小弟)

Long-run Natural Monopoly
- MC 很低: 服務規模↑ (規模經濟)

Perfect Competition vs Monopolistic Competition
|.|perfect|monopolistic|
|-|-|-|
|markup|0|P(D) - P(MR=MC)|
|excess capacity|0|Q(ATC=MC) - Q(MR=MC)|
-
efficient? cannot quantify benefits of "differentiation"
-
to maintain being monopolistic, they need to
- innovate: to differentiate
- advertise: to shift D rightward  (ATC↑)
	- branded = high quality?

[ Laws ]

Regulation of Natural Monopoly
| |social surplus | consumer surplus|producer surplus|
|--|--|--|--|
|MC = MR| ★|★ |★★★|
|LRAC = D| ★★★|★★ |★★|
|MC = D|★★ |★★★ |★|
-
- government don't know LRAC/MC, use
	- 舊 rate of return regulation
	  => want to 浮報成本
	- 新 price cap regulation
	  => want to 降低成本/進步
	     (+ earnings sharing regulation: 回饋消費者)
