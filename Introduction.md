Physics:    game with rule set by God
Economics:  game with rule set by us => how can be better?
- step
	- observe
	- detect pattern (non-causal):  empirical analysis
	- construct theory (causal):    economic modeling
	- predict:                      empirical prediction

Mathematics in Economics
- why
	- math = rigor,  rigor + intuition = scientific method
- variety
	- hard:  theorist, econometrics
	- easy:  applied theory, applied econometrics
	- static:   micro
	- dynamic:  macro
- relation
	- basics:  calculus, linear algebra
	- medium:  <u>diff. equation</u>, real analysis
	- advanced:  <u>time series</u>, <u>Fourier analysis</u>
	- extra:  topology,
