Yes, it is generally true that dynamic optimization problems often rely more on numerical methods than static optimization problems. The key difference between dynamic and static optimization lies in how they handle time or sequences of decisions.

Static optimization problems involve making decisions at a single point in time, where the objective is to find the best solution among a set of feasible choices. These problems can often be solved analytically using mathematical techniques such as calculus, linear programming, or convex optimization when the problem's mathematical structure allows for it. Analytical solutions are preferred because they provide precise, closed-form solutions.

On the other hand, dynamic optimization problems involve making decisions over a sequence of time periods, taking into account how decisions made at one point in time affect future decisions and outcomes. These problems often lead to what are known as dynamic programming problems. Dynamic programming involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. While there are some dynamic programming problems that have analytical solutions (e.g., the classic example of the deterministic optimal control problem solved using the Pontryagin's maximum principle), many real-world dynamic optimization problems do not have straightforward analytical solutions.

As a result, numerical methods become essential for solving dynamic optimization problems. These numerical methods can include techniques like finite difference methods, finite element methods, numerical integration, and various iterative algorithms. Solving dynamic optimization problems numerically allows for the consideration of complex, non-linear dynamics and uncertainties, which are often encountered in practical applications like economics, engineering, and finance.

In summary, while both static and dynamic optimization problems can benefit from numerical methods, dynamic optimization problems typically rely more heavily on numerical techniques due to the inherent complexity of considering time-dependent decisions and interactions.
