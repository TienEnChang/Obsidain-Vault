Def. A <u>category</u> is a structure that has
	 (1) Objects
	 (2) Morphisms
	 (3) Composition
	 (4) Identities
	 and satisfies the
	 (1) Identity Law
	 (2) Associativity Law

Def. A <u>functor</u> is a translation between 2 categories, with
	 (1) Objects translation
	 (2) Morphisms translation
	 (3) Identity preservation
	 (4) Composition preservation

Def. A <u>natural transformation</u> is a translation between 2 functors

â€» isomorphic ($\cong$), equivalence ($\simeq$), adjunction (?)

Ex. The <u>set theory</u> is a category with
	(1) Objects = Sets
	(2) Morphisms = Relations
	(3) Composition (v)
	(4) Identities (v)
	and it satisfies the
	(1) Identity Law (v)
	(2) Associativity Law (v)

Ex. The <u>category theory</u> is a category with
	(1) Objects = Categories
	(2) Morphisims = Functors
	(3) Composition (v)
	(4) Identities (v)
	and it satisfies the
	(1) Identity Law (v)
	(2) Associativity Law (v)
