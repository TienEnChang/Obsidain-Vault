Learning Mechanism  (i.e. self-development / growth)
- internal reward system:
	- successful action / new discovery => satisfaction / pleasure

Pruning
- thickness of cortical layer↓  (more efficient conduction)

Developmental Progression
(1)
- Birth => Childhood (3yo):   synapse wiring ↑↑  ( x2 more )
- Childhood => Adult (20yo):  synapse pruning ↑↑ ( noise clearing )
(2)
- Sensory / Motor                       { visual, sensory, motor cortex }
  => Association: Language / Math      { parietal(↑) association cortex }
  => Higher: Decision Making / Problem Solving   { prefrontal(←) cortex }
