Mind, Brain, Education:
- fields
	- Neuroscience + Psychology + Education
- purpose
  (1) while <u>learning</u>:  record + decipher <u>brain activity</u>
  (2) evaluate <u>existing techniques</u> for education
  (3) develop <u>better techniques</u> backed by neuroscience
- difficulties
	- experimental env. ≠ real school env. (too artificial)
	- avg. phenomenon ≠ suitable for each one
- contribution so far
	(x) new techniques
	(v) early diagnosis / cause analysis of
	- dyscalculia:  math.
	- dyslexia:  reading,  text =x> speech / meaning

Cornerstone ideas in MBE
(1) brain is unique:  nature (genetic, gift) & nurture (environmental)
(2) brain is adaptive
- able to rewire into different function  (neuroplasticity)
- able to connect new info to old  (consolidation) (REM)

Neuroplasticity
- def.
	- structural plasticity:  experience => rewire
	- functional plasticity:  injury => rewire
