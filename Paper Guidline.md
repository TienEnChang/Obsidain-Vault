什麼是研究？
你為什麼做研究？
- private
	- threat
		- don't have 好學經歷 (for-academic)
		- can't 推甄 to 好碩班 / 博班 (國外)
		- => don't have 好履歷 (for-job)
		- => can't feel 工作與 "志向" (autonomy) 相符
		- => can't feel 工作有意義
		- => 痛苦不得志 & 窮忙！
	- oppurtunity
		- 大專生研究計畫
	- purpose
		- for 經營履歷 (往上攻讀)
		- for 鍛鍊自己的研究能力, 為未來做準備 (提早)
		- for 找到困擾多年的問題的答案
	- can help the humanity on what? so can get sponsorship?

Here, I have a number of statements listed in order. Please help me correct typos, connect them into a sensible manner, and produce a paragraph that is suitible for a scientific paper.

{scale}

Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) [@(Kirby et al. 1999)]

the PSU scale, the BW scale = @14 >> Kwon, M., Kim, D.J., Cho, H.H., & Yang, S. (2013). The Smartphone Addiction Scale: Development and Validation of a Short Version for Adolescents. PLoS ONE, 8.


{SDT rationale provisioning}
- relevance:
	- 1. meaningful for (v) recipiant (x) provider
	- 2. (v) specific (x) vague
	- 3. goal type
		- (x) extrinsic goal: money, fame
		- (v) intrinsic goal: 
			- personal development
			- contributing to the community
			- health
			- affiliation / fun together
	- 4. novelty
		- (x) familiar: reduntant / irritation
		- (v) novel: reveil the unawared / hidden ones
What are the goals of the participants?
- root rationale
	- help contributing to science
	- try overcoming addiction of one's own
- options
	- read original paper (already briefly introduced)
	    $+$ write down notes (reading-time $\propto$ word-count)
		- maximizer & satisficer ([Good enough—compromise between desirability and feasibility: An alternative perspective on satisficing](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Good-enough%E2%80%94compromise-between-desirability-and-An-Luan-Li/bcc68424b5800d430d8f1a9810e4525f0eac8427))

		- gratitude & serotonin
		- status-quo bias (go / no-go? detour?)
- technique
	- note paper: at the top of the page, ask them
		- what brings you here?
		- why do you want to read into the details instead of keep playing the game?
	- checkbox:
		- template answers + others ...
		    (guided questions = self-generated rationale) 
	- tone: (v) inviting (x) commanding (pressure-free)
- why it works?
	- percieved choice: can choose
		- (1) which paper to read
		- (2) how much to write
	- intrinsic goal
		- personal development on "addiction coping"
		- contributing to the "science" community
		- "mental" health
	- self-endorsed
		- ask & answer
	- responsibility (x)
	- gratitude (non-recipiant-based) (x)

{Brain Areas, Neuroimaging}

Associated brain regions include: ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral striatum (Clithero et al., 2014; Kable et al., 2007; Padoa-Schioppa et al., 2006). Studies have shown that chronic drug abuser exhibit abnormalities in the frontal, especially OFC, cingulate, and limbic cortices (Bolla et al., 2003; Morales et al 2012; Thompson et al., 2004).

Others
- ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (Venkatraman et al., 2009),-
- orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
- nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (Kim et al., 2007).
EEG-related
- preference formation
	- sustained posterior ERP positivity
	- increase of frontal theta band oscillations
	- increase of posterior gamma band oscillations (Lindsen et al., 2010).
- effort
	- supplementary motor area
		- dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (Klein-Flügge et al., 2016)
	- anterior portion of the inferior frontal gyrus
		- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
		- anterior cingulate cortex (Massar, 2015)
	- dorsomedial region (Suzuki et al., 2020)
	- ventral striatum (Marco-Pallarés et al., 2010)
- inhibition
	- ventral striatum (Suzuki et al., 2020)

- EEG: medial frontal cortex
	- In sum, we found that the fronto-parietal network supports different phases of decision process. The reward anticipation was reflected by positivity in medial frontal cortex, while the lateral prefrontal and lateral parietal regions participated in integration of reward and stimulus orientation, respectively. This was more apparent in the feedback stage when the lateral frontal regions encoded a combination of reward values for symmetric rewards and the integration with spatial information for asymmetric rewards.
